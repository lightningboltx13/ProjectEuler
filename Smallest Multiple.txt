2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
_______________________________________________________________



only looking at the prime numbers up to 20

if this is true then for the example (2520:1 to 10) then you only need the primes up to 10
[2,3,5,7]
you also need an squared of these numbers that are within the 1 to 10 range
2^2

predict you need 9.


2*4*5*7*9=2520 or 9*8*7*5

Needed Prime Numbers and the Largest Exponent of Primes that is within range. If the Prime has an exponent within range remove that prime.
Example
2^3 = 8; which is within the 1 to 10 range. so we use the 8 instead of the 2.
3^2 = 9; which is within the 1 to 10 range. se we use the 9 instead of the 3.

Product = 1;
Prime = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]

for(int Index = 0; Index < Prime.length; Index++;)
	if(Prime[Index]^n <= 20)
		Product *= Prime^n

16,9,5,7,11,13,17,19


this problem was solved less with code and more with math, creating a method that allows you to imput a range of integers and find the smallest divisable by all numbers within the range is the next step.
